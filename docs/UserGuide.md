# User Guide

CLIentTracker is a **desktop CRM designed for property agents, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still retaining the benefits of a simple visual interface. It allows agents to manage clients, listings, and notes quickly through commands such as `add`, `edit`, `find`, and `list`. If you can type fast, CLIentTracker lets you update and retrieve information significantly faster than traditional GUI-based CRM systems.


Unlike many web-based CRMs, CLIentTracker works **fully offline**, allowing agents to continue working seamlessly in environments with poor or unstable connectivity, such as property viewings, new developments, or while on the move. Core operations like searching for clients or updating details can be done instantly without waiting for pages to load or systems to sync. When the application is closed, all data is automatically saved and archived, ensuring that records remain secure without requiring manual backups.


CLIentTracker is built for agents who value **speed, reliability, and control**. By removing dependency on internet access and reducing interaction to simple, efficient commands, it enables agents to focus on their clients rather than their tools—making it especially effective in fast-paced, real-world selling environments where every second counts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `find n/John` : Finds for the string "John" in the name field. 

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Command summary](#command-summary) below for a quick list of all commands or [Features](#features) for detailed descriptions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Command summary

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Name search: `find n/NAME_KEYWORD`
* Phone search: `find p/PHONE_NUMBER`
* Address search: `find a/ADDRESS_KEYWORD`
* Email search: `find e/EMAIL_KEYWORD`

**For general search:**
* Searches across **name, phone, address, email, and details**.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `alex` will match `Alex`
* Partial matches are supported. e.g. `lex` will match `Alex`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `find alex` will return persons whose fields contain `alex`

**For field-specific search (using prefixes):**
* Searches only within the specified field.
* The search is case-insensitive.
* Partial matches are supported for all fields.
* Keywords within the same field are matched using **OR** logic.
  e.g. `find n/Alex John` returns persons whose **name** contains `Alex` or `John`
* Different fields can be combined and are matched using **AND** logic.
  e.g. `find n/Alex p/9123` returns persons whose **name** contains `Alex` and whose **phone** contains `9123`

**Supported prefixes:**
* `n/` — name
* `p/` — phone
* `a/` — address
* `e/` — email
* `d/` — details

**Prefix behavior:**
* Once a prefix is used, all following unprefixed keywords are treated as belonging to that same field until another prefix appears.

* e.g. `find n/Alex p/9123 Bob` searches for persons whose **name** contains `Alex`, and whose **phone** contains `9123` or `Bob`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
